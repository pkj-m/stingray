    How to calculate a single-trial probability when we only have
    a multi-trial one? This might be the case because, e.g., we
    want to have a 10% probability of detecting a signal in an
    entire power spectrum, and we need to correct the detection
    level accordingly.

    The typical procedure is dividing the initial probability
    (often called _epsilon_) by the number of trials. This is
    often a good approximation, but it is not formally correct.
    If epsilon * n approaches 1, this approximation gives
    incorrect results.

    Here we calculate this probability by inverting the Binomial
    problem. Given that (see ``p_multitrial_from_single_trial``)
    the probability of getting more than one hit in n trials,
    given the single-trial probability _p_, is

    P (k ≥ 1) =  1 - (1 - p)^n,
